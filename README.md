# Simple TODO list
This is a basic javascript practice project, i created three list using html list tag and upon mouse hover the list get to change it color to green

## Javascript section 

On the js file i get to achive the above todo functionalities by using two separate steps which is:

1) I used a For loop statement for iteration and an eventlistener for the functionality of mouseover and mouseout  

2) forEach: this performs same as the for loop statement but just a little bit of code changes
